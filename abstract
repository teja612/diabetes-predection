Diabetes is an illness caused because of high glucose level in a human body. Diabetes should not be ignored if it is untreated then Diabetes may cause some major issues in a person like: heart related problems, Kidney problem, Blood pressure, eye damage and it can also affects other organs of human body. Diabetes can be controlled if it is predicted earlier. The huge burden of Diabetes cases in India represents a unique set of problems, and provides us with a unique opportunity in terms of potential availability of data. Big Data Analytics plays an significant role in healthcare industries. Healthcare industries have large volume databases. Using big data analytics one can study huge datasets and find hidden information, hidden patterns to discover knowledge from the data and predict outcomes accordingly. In existing method, the classification and prediction accuracy is not so high. we have proposed a diabetes prediction model for better classification of diabetes which includes few external factors responsible for diabetes along with regular factors like Glucose, BMI, Age, Insulin, etc. Classification accuracy is
boosted with new dataset compared to existing dataset .To achieve this goal this project work will do early prediction of Diabetes in a human body or a patient for a higher accuracy thoroughly applying, various Machine Learning Techniques. In this work we will use Machine Learning Classification and ensemble techniques on a dataset to predict diabetes.
